    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Crispy Baked Chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Broccoli</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium head broccoli</li>
        <li>a splash of olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Orange Chicken Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Orange Zest from one orange</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of orange juice, even better if freshly squeezed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Cornstarch</li>
        <li>a couple dashes of red pepper flakes,<em>to taste</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Prepare the broccoli: place the broccoli on the baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then spread into an even layer on one side of the sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chicken: Place breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper into a large ziptop bag. Shake a little to combine. Add the chicken pieces, seal, then shake to coat the chicken evenly. Place the chicken pieces in a single layer on the open side of the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and turn the chicken pieces over. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 5 to 10 additional minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. When a piece of chicken is cut, the juices should run clear.</li>
        <li>While the chicken cooks, prepare the sauce: In a medium saucepan (one large enough to hold the sauce and the chicken), whisk together the orange zest, orange juice, honey, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. In a small bowl, whisk together the water and corn starch, until it is very smooth. Add to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the sauce is thickened and reduced, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the red pepper flakes. Taste (be careful; it will be hot!) and adjust the seasoning as desired.</li>
        <li>Add the baked chicken to the pot and stir to coat with the sauce. If the broccoli is not yet as crisp as you would like, spread it out over the surface of the entire pan (including the open side where you were previously roasting the chicken) and return it to the oven until it is as baked as you like (I left it in for about 3 more minutes). Stir the green onions into the pot with the chicken. Serve hot with the roasted broccoli and rice.</li>
    </ol>
