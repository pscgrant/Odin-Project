// creating the variable message using let
//let message;
// can also visualize the concept of a "variable" if imagined it as a "box" for data, 
// with a uniquely named sticker on it. The variable "message" can be a box labeled "message" with the value "Hello!" in it. 
// We can put any value in the box, we can also change it as many times as we want. 

//message = 'Hello'; // now the string 'Hello' is stored into the variable message

//alert(message); // shows the variable content
// this pops up an alert popup on the browser saying Hello

// can also make this more concise
//let message = 'Hello!';
//alert(message);
