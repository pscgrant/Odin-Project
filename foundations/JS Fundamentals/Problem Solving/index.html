        /* This problem is solving Fizz Buzz: rite a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. 
        However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
        For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
         */
        /* Our Plan: The desired output is a list of numbers from 1 to the number the user entered. 
           But each number that is divisible by 3 will output "Fizz", each number that is divisible by 5 will output "Buzz"
           and each number that is divisible by 3 and 5 will output "FizzBuzz".
        */

          1. When a user inputs a number
          2. Loop from 1 to the entered number
          3. If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
          4. If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
          5. If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
          6. Otherwise print the current number

           Declare variable i and assign it 1. We want to loop until i is greater than "answer" which is what i <= answer does.
